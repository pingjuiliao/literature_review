- Problem: existing PKU-based isolation approches are not complete.
- Method: a PKU-based sandboxing framework to overcome limitations of existing approaches.
  - conclusively handle unsafe instructions
  - Full PKU-pitfall protection except for Signal context attacks.
- Result: comeplete handle of unsafe instructions and PKU pitfalls protections while requires minor kernel change.
- Future Work:
